Why Network Installation
========================

Installing operating systems and patches manually can become a cumbersome process involving long periods of partial down-time and requiring many hours of work.  The issues associated with manual installs are only made even worse when scaled up, such as in large data-centers.  

Network installations mitigate the time spent updating networks by running installs simultaneously across the network in a configurable fashion.  This allows for data-centers to schedule updates, have rolling updates and generally avoid the hassle of manually updating nodes.  

Furthermore, network installation permits greater flexibility in updating networks as they can be executed by a much smaller team. 
In general network installations are simply more automated and less time intensive when compared to their manual counterparts.
