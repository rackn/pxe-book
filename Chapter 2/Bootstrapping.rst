What is Bootstrapping?
======================

"Bootstrapping" as a term for computing that emerged in the 1950's. Once an initial program, typically the BIOS, is started, the computer boots itself through a series of increasingly complex and intensive programs that serve to start up the goal program which is the most complex. This goes on until the computer is fully booted, having, following the adage, "pulled itself up by its bootstraps." The initial program, often referred to as BIOS, is stored as firmware, usually in a ROM.

The BIOS initializes memory, starts CPUs, and enables access to I/O (Input/Output) devices, such as disks or network cards. The BIOS then searches for additional programs to load. This next program is usually called a "boot loader" or "bootstrap loader." The bootstrap loader resides in the MBR (Master Boot Record) on the hard drive and knows how to read the disk to look for the next part of the Operating System, a kernel (to use the linux term). The kernel searches for, initializes, and tests other programs needed to complete the operating system start-up.

There is also bootstrapping specific to nodes. These bootstrapping nodes, also known as rendezvous hosts, give configuration information to nodes new to the network to help them join. A rendezvous host makes it so the user does not need people to initialize each new node. A new node needs configuration information or else it will not be able to join the network and communicate with other nodes. These bootstrapping-specific nodes are usually defined by their services. Some examples include RARP, BOOTP, DHCP, TFTP, HTTP, IPv6 Autoconf, and NDP.

Within Digital Rebar, Sledgehammer is a bootstrapping tool used to perform initial node discovery and the register the nodes discovered state within the Digital Rebar node provisioning framework.
