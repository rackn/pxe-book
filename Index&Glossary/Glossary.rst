1. Admin Node: The system running the containers needed for Digital Rebar. It can be Virtual Machine (VM) or Physical.

2. Anneal: The method of processing un-run Node Roles on Nodes. 
attribute injection

B
~
1. Bare Metal Node: Any physical node managed by Digital Rebar.

2. Bootstrapping: The booting of a computer from a powered-off state by loading an operating system into the memory.

C
~
1. Classifier: A go-based program that processes a rules file. A system can have multiple classifiers to enable system and user-based classifiers.

2. Cloudwrap: A container that provides a cloud abstraction service which enables the Rebar API core to create, modify, and destroy nodes in various sets of clouds.

3. Consul: A distributed discovery and configuration service as well as a key-value store. 

D
~
1. DHCP: Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol is a client-server protocol that enables a server to automatically assign IP addresses to a subnet.

2. DRP: Digital Rebar Provision is a simple Golang executable that provides a simple yet complete API-driven DHCP/PXE/TFTP provisioning system.

E
~
1. etcd: A distributed key-value store that servers as a hub for cluster coordination. It uses the Raft protocol.

1. HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol is an application protocol for the exchange and transfer of hypertext. 

I
~
1. iPXE HTTP: An open-source version of Preboot Execution Environment that fetches boot files using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol. 

2. IPMI: Intelligent Platform Management Interface is a set of computer interface specifications for out-of-band management (see OOBM).

J

K
~
1. Kernel: The core of an operating system whose primary task is to mediate access to the CPU, memory, and devices. 

L
~
1. Late Binding: A class of 4th generation languages that do not require
programmers to know all the details of the information they will store until the data is actually stored

M
~
1. Managed Node: Any node that is managed by Digital Rebar. Can be VM or Physical.

N
~
1. Node: A connection point in a network that can create and communicate information to other nodes in the network. 

2. Node Role: An instance of a role on a specific node. These are sequenced into a directed graph and annealed to completion.

O
~
1. OOBM: Out-of-band management is any system that allows for remote access to devices on a network.

P
~
1. PXE: Preboot Execution Environment is a standard client-server interface which allows administrators to remotely configure and boot unloaded computers on their network. 

Q
~

R 
~
1. Raft: A consensus algorithm that creates a consensus in clusters of machines by offering a way for the clusters to elect a leader.

2. Role: An atomic piece of functionality to apply to a node. It is represented by an object_role.

S
~
1. Simulated Annealing: A modeling strategy from computer science that seeks optimal or stable outcomes through iterative analysis.

2. Sledgehammer: A RAM-only boot environment served by the provisioner for metal node discovery.

3. SSH: A network protocol that allows administrators to securely operate remote computers. It stands for Secure Shell.

T
~
1. TFTP: Trivial File Transfer Protocol is a simple file transfer utility that is used without authentication or a visible directory. 

U
~
1. Unicast: To send out a message to a single recipient. It is the opposite of broadcasting. 

2. UUID: A Universally Unique Identifier is a 128-bit number assigned to a set of information. Also referred to as a Globally Unique Identifier (GUID).
