RackN PXE & Immutable Provisioning Book
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Preface
=======

Executive Summary
=================

Network Booting servers and data center infrastructure are primary concerns for everyone running even the most rudimentary IT environment from middle school Raspberry Pi clusters to hyperscale data centers at Google, Amazon and Microsoft.  The process is highly constrained and opaque due to both the archaic firmware and the labyrinthine protocols used within data centers.  This book describes the careful dance required to successfully install operating systems over a network.  It will provide step-by-step instructions and detailed explanations of each step to help guide and supervise the network installation of operating systems.  This book will use the open-source Digital Rebar Provisioning solution for hands-on reference examples because it is small, multi-platform and accessible with minimal installation.
