UEFI vs. Traditional BIOS
=========================


























In PXE Linux there are spcs for the kernel
Elilo takes a similar set of options in a different format

Have tooling to proivde those images

By Default the DHCP has the bootfile that it serves to nodes in that it tells nodes how to boot

If always booting UEFI, put boot.x64.efi

asks for eulilo conf and not boot conf.

DRP asks for the network architecture which allows a mixed system, can send the correct response to the server from the client through DRP by looking at the parameter expansion inside option fields, get option from packet and test a value


{{if (eq (index . 77) “iPXE”) }}default.ipxe{{else if (eq (index . 93) “0")}}lpxelinux.0{{else}}bootx64.efi{{end}}

This string will let DRP detect mode
makes choices about the clients to decide their booting location
