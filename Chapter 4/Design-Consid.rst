Design Considerations
=====================

When Developing an infrastructure there are many challenges and options that a development team must overcome and consider.  Many of these challenges can be avoided or mitigated with different server configurations but for the development team all configurations must be accounted for and supported if possible.  For instance with Digital Rebar Provision the development team realized that they could either create a 64 bit software which would be incompatible with Raspberry Pi and Arduino node systems, or they could create a 32 bit system which would be compatible but would be more time consuming.  The team decided that it was more important to develop the 64 bit system as it caters to a larger audience, and has more applications outside of education.  These types of decisions can greatly impact the usability of any infrastructure software and are critical when developing for the infinite number of possible network environments.
