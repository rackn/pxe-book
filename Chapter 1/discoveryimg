Discovery Image: Install Discovery Bootenv
==========================================























Multiple ways: 

2 classes

1 prescriptivly register every address, know about machines

-DRP Discovery Image: Sledgehammer
--RAM only centos image, provides inventory info and others

---Stored in S3 bucket
---Discovery pulls a reference sledgehammer image and sets up drp to serve the image

When a request comes in the DHCP server can give the machine a kernel
-Typically DHCP default unknown machine boot environment set to no
-system inventories itself and then uses the inventory to register itself with DRP which then appears in UI 

Discovery Image not required, could create inside DRP machine entries by assigning name and IP address into the system
