The world of PXE booting and network provisioning is a highly complex and often difficult place.  There are incompatibility issues, hardware and firmware difficulties, and often difficulties that are just inherent to the sheer number of nodes on a network.  There are many problems that engineers and data-center technicians must work tirelessly to solve. Fortunately, these problems have led to the development of provisioners: software packages that provide assistance and reliability to otherwise fickle systems, with less human intervention.  Among these projects, Digital Rebar and its Digital Rebar Provision software is one of the most well-developed and stable.  In this book, the basics of PXE will be explained in reference to Digital Rebar Provision, as it provides a useful tool for network development.  The best way to learn about this new stage in data-center management is by testing and fiddling with the new tools of the industry.  That is why this writing team recommends that readers use and explore Digital Rebar Provision as a way to not only become more acquainted with the solutions to the problems of network management but also to explore the problems that still remain.
