The world of PXE booting and network provisioning is a highly complex and often difficult place.  There are incompatibility issues, hardware and firmware difficulties, and often times difficulties just inherent to the shear number of nodes on a network.  There are many problems that engineers and data-center technicians must work tirelessly to solve.  Fortunately these problems have led to the development of provisioners, software packages that provide assistance and reliability to otherwise fickle systems, with less human intervention.  Among these projects, Digital Rebar and it's Digital Rebar Provision software is one of the most well developed and stable.  In this book, the basics of PXE will be explained with reference to Digital Rebar Provision as it provides a useful tool for network development.  In order to learn about this new stage in data-center management, it is best to learn by testing and fiddling with the new tools of the industry.  That is why the writing team recommends that readers use and explore Digital Rebar Provision as a way to become more acquainted not only with the solutions to the problems of network management, but also to explore the problems that still remain.
