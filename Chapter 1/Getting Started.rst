===============

This section guides users through the steps needed to begin Digital Rebar Provisioning, also referred to as DRP. Digital Rebar Provision is a stand-alone version of the PXE/DHCP/TFTP system used by the broader Digital Rebar project. It is a great first step for the larger project and sufficient for those just looking to replace Cobbler or another metal provisioner (MaaS, Stacki, Foreman, USB, etcetera). DRP does not have out-of-band or firmware features - those services remain under the project umbrella.

The requirements for DRP are a DHCP and PXE server and, if installing on Windows, a laptop with Virtual Box. Virtual Box is a virtual machine monitor developed by the Oracle Corporation. 

For Mac and Linux, the first step is to download DRP and make sure that the DHCP is isolated. From there, go to Chapter 1.4 "Discovery Image: Install Linux Bootenv" for further instructions. 

In all virtual machines, the first step is to host the virtual machine with Linux. The next step is installing DRP. This path works well for Windows. The instructions for VMs are continued in Chapter 1.5 "Working OS: Install Centos Bootenv."
